# CQTools

### Description
At CQURE, our passion for cybersecurity goes hand in hand with innovation. Over the years, we’ve developed a comprehensive suite of internal tools – forged in the heat of penetration testing engagements, incident response cases, and fueled by our own deep-dive research. These tools aren’t just theoretical – they were born out of real-world challenges we encountered during projects.
Each tool usually starts as a tiny spark – an idea mid-project – and then the research begins. Sometimes it takes days. Sometimes, years. But the result? A powerful toolkit built to actually get the job done.

CQTools cover the full spectrum of offensive and forensic operations – from sniffing and spoofing, to password and information extraction, custom payload and shell generation, bypassing antivirus protections, keylogging, and more. It’s a surgical toolkit designed for deep, infrastructure-wide operations.

Some of the tools are powered by discoveries made by the CQURE Team and released publicly for the first time in the world. For example:

1. We were the first team (as far as we know) to fully reverse engineer DPAPI (Data Protection Application Programming Interface). With our tools, a lot can be decrypted. ;)
2. We developed the first public tool to monitor the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
3. We have put into pieces the EVTX files and we can remove chosen events in them.
4. We have a full forensic toolkit allowing us to extract information that's not described in any book. 

We’ve created hundreds of tools over the years (yep), and while some remain internal, we’re sharing more and more with the community over time.

So stay tuned — this is just the beginning. **Enjoy!**
